# INTRODUCTION:
* JavaScript was initially created as a browser-only language, but it is now used in many other environments as well.
* We can use a <script> tag to add JavaScript code to a page.
* We can declare variables to store data by using the var, let, or const keywords.
* let – is a modern variable declaration.
* var – is an old-school variable declaration. Normally we don’t use it at all, but we’ll cover subtle differences from let in the chapter 
  The old "var", just in case you need them.
* const – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
* for output on the screen  we use console.log
```javascript
var firstName = "vivek";
console.log(firstName); // vivek
```
* upadte var variable without using var keyword
```javascript
firstName =  "kumar";
console.log(firstName); // kumar
```
* let firstName = "ajay"; we can't use firstName here   
```javascript
let name = "harshit";
name = "Mohit";
console.log(name); // Mohit
``` 
```javascript
const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi); // 3.14
```
